a challenge for Laravel developer position in Masdr team.
Create a Pizza order application

Implement the following logic using the Laravel framwork.

Your pizza ordering application should be with the following functionality:

    Add Pizza:
    -- All crud functionality shoud be implemented.

    Order pizza:
    -- All crud functionality shoud be implemented.
    -- It should be possible to specify the desired flavors of pizza, the number of pizzas and their size.
    -- An order should contain information regarding the customer (Customer name and Address are must).

    Update an order:
    -- You can only update the status of delivery for the order
    -- You can not delete an order unless it's delieverd.

    Retrieve an order:
    -- It should be possible to retrieve the order by id or name.

    List orders:
    -- List all the orders at once.
    -- Filter orders by customer name or the status of delivery.

You must implement a way to check the status of delivery.
It's possible to order the same flavor of pizza but with different sizes multiple times.
Tasks

    Implement and design the model / database structure.
    Implement the functionality and API endpoints.
    Add a brief README with instructions on how to get your code from Git clone to up and running on macOS and/or Linux hosts.

Bonus Points

    Implement the task to be running on docker (we expect to see 1 docker-compose in your project).
    Implement tests at least one test case for controller and one for the API endpoints.
    Experience and implementation of laravel caching is a big plus. ..

Please note!
* Use PHP 7.2+ and the latest releases of Laravel.
* You have to implement laravel authentication for laravel 7
* You don't have to implement any frontend UI.
* Keep your endpoints as RESTful as possible.
* You have to write meaningful git commits (This is very important in working with us remotely).
* Push the code to a public repo on your account and send us the link.
* Also you must track the time you spend on the code honestly (with any tool you want).
